    @brief Container class for aggregation information.

    @ingroup Aggregation

    Structure holding aggregate information. Right now, nAggregates, IsRoot,
    Vertex2AggId, procWinner are populated.  This allows us to look at a node
    and determine the aggregate to which it has been assigned and the id of the
    processor that owns this aggregate. It is not so easy to determine vertices
    within the kth aggregate or the size of the kth aggregate. Thus, it might be
    useful to have a secondary structure which would be a rectangular CrsGraph
    where rows (or vertices) correspond to aggregates and colunmns (or edges)
    correspond to nodes. While not strictly necessary, it might be convenient.
